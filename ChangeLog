ChangeLog for R Package "copBasic" by W.H. Asquith
----------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.4---October 30, 2008 Initial Release

Version 1.5.0---August 31, 2011
1.  Enhancement on derCOPinv.R when a solution is unbounded in uniroot()
      to return NA as needed. This was discovered in massive simulation
      from simcompositeCOP()---massive means 500k simulation counts.
2. Added Nelson's copula in equation 4.2.12 as the N4212cop() function.
3. Removed and restructured the tabulated L-comoment solutions to the
     Plackett-Plackett copula to clean up some loose ends and set up the
     ability to load much much larger solutions sets that are too big
     for CRAN distribution.
4. Major construction of the data subdirectory and changes to documentation.
     Removed comp2lcomsPlackettPlackett.Rd, comp2lcomsPlackettPlackett2.Rd,
     lcom2PLACKETTPLACKETTcop.R/Rd.
5. Added lcomoms2.cop2parameter.R/Rd (replaces lcom2PLACKETTPLACKETTcop.R/Rd).
6. Added data/PlackettPlackettNP.RData and man/PlackettPlackettNP.Rd.


Version 1.5.1---November 14, 2011
1. Added data/PlackettPlackettABKGtest.RData and
     man/PlackettPlackettABKGtest.Rd.
2. Removed lcomoms2.cop2parameter.R/Rd.
3. Added lcomoms2.ABcop2parameter.R/Rd (replaces lcomoms2.cop2parameter.R/Rd).
4. Added lcomoms2.ABKGcop2parameter.R/Rd.
5. BUG FIX: Labeling inconsistency when sectionCOP() called
     with dercop=FALSE.
6. Added the EMPIRcop() function for estimation of the empirical copula.
7. Added the EMPIRcopdf() function to compute the entire data.frame() of
     the empirical copula---the copula for each coordinate is computed.
8. Added the EMPIRgrid() function for computation of a regular grid of
     the empirical copula---this grid will form the basis of other copula
     operations on the empirical copula.
9. Added the EMPIRgridder() and EMPIRgridder2() functions for
     computation of the sectional derivatives of the empirical copula from
     EMPIRgrid().
10. Added the EMPIRgridderinv() and EMPIRgridderinv2() functions for
     computation of the sectional derivatives of the empirical copula from
     EMPIRgrid().
11. Added the EMPIRqua.regress() and EMPIRqua.regress2() functions for
     quantile regression from grid emanating from EMPIRgridderinv() and
     EMPIRgridderinv2().
12. Added the EMPIRmed.regress() and EMPIRmed.regress2() functions for
     median regression from grid emanating from EMPIRgridderinv() and
     EMPIRgridderinv2().
13. Added the EMPIRsim() function for simulation of V given U from the
     empirical copula.
14. Added the EMPIRsimv() function for simulation of V given U (by 
     argument) from the empirical copula.
15. Documentation fixes in derCOP2.Rd, lcomoms2.ABcop2parameters.Rd,
     lcomoms2.ABKGcop2parameter.Rd, PlackettPlackettNP.Rd, and
     qua.regressCOP.Rd.
16. Enhanced error handling with COPinv(), COPinv2(), derCOPinv(), and
     derCOPinv2().
17. Enhancement to derCOP() and derCOP2() by changing derivative direction
     if near the 0 or 1 boundaries.
