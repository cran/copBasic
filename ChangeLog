ChangeLog for R Package "copBasic" by W.H. Asquith
----------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.4---October 30, 2008 Initial Release

Version 1.5.0---August 31, 2011
1.  Enhancement on derCOPinv.R when a solution is unbounded in uniroot()
      to return NA as needed. This was discovered in massive simulation
      from simcompositeCOP()---massive means 500k simulation counts.
2. Added Nelson's copula in equation 4.2.12 as the N4.2.12cop() function. 
3. Removed and restructured the tabulated L-comoment solutions to the
     Plackett-Plackett copula to clean up some loose ends and set up the
     ability to load much much larger solutions sets that are too big
     for CRAN distribution.
4. Major construction of the data subdirectory and changes to documentation.
     Removed comp2lcomsPlackettPlackett.Rd, comp2lcomsPlackettPlackett2.Rd,
     lcom2PLACKETTPLACKETTcop.R/Rd
5. Added lcomoms2.cop2parameter.R/Rd (replaces lcom2PLACKETTPLACKETTcop.R/Rd)
6. Added data/PlackettPlackettNP.RData and man/PlackettPlackettNP.Rd
